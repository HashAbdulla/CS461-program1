## Route-finding using search algorithms program

This C++ program implements 5 search algorithms:  
**brute-force (blind search)**  
**breadth-first search**  
**depth-first search**  
**iterative deepening depth-first search (ID-DFS)**  
**best-first search**  
and A* Search

in order to find a route between two towns.   
Given a dataset of towns and their adjacencies, the program allows users to select a starting and ending town, choose a search method, and view the computed route along with execution time and total distance.

I used the LLM "DeepSeek" in order to generate the C++ code and prompts used:
