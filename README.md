## Route-finding using search algorithms program by Hashim Abdulla

This program implements five search algorithms—brute-force (blind search), breadth-first search, depth-first search, iterative deepening depth-first search (ID-DFS), best-first search, and A* search—to find a route between two towns.   
Given a dataset of towns and their adjacencies, the program allows users to select a starting and ending town, choose a search method, and view the computed route along with execution time and total distance.
